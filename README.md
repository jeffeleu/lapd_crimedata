# Data Sourcing, Storing, and Modeling of LAPD Crime Data from 2020 to Present

## Data Explanation
The data comes from an inital reporting of a crime to law enforcement (either from emergency phone calls (911), visits to the police station, or online reporting, etc) in the city of Los Angeles. Law enforcement officers or operators collect information about the reported crime such as the type of crime, location, time and date of occurrence, descriptions of suspects or victims. The information is then classified and documented (according to the data source, the original crime reports were typed on paper). The provided dataset is a transcribed version of the original paper documentation.

## Sourcing 

The data was sourced from catalog.data.gov, where the 'Crime Data from 2020 to Present' dataset from the LAPD was selected. To understand the dataset better, the data origin and its accompanying data dictionary were reviewed, and an Excel file was created to store the dictionary for easy reference.

A Python script using Pandas and NumPy was then written to load the dataset, create a DataFrame, and output the column names and data shape, providing an overview of its structure.

## Storing

The data was stored using Microsoft Azure Storage. A resource group and a container were created within Azure to house the data. To upload the sourced data, the sourcing script was updated to utilize the BlobServiceClient, BlobClient, and ContainerClient classes from the azure.storage.blob library. These classes enable efficient connection establishment, access to the appropriate container and blob, and streamlined data upload.

## Modeling

The data modeling process began with identifying the facts and dimensions. The fact table includes foreign keys referencing the dimension tables. The following dimensions were identified for the data warehouse: Crime, Premise, Victim, Datetime, Location, and Status. Next, DBSchema was used to visualize and design the database system. The SQL script generated by the model was then saved for data warehousing purposes.
